# T-BOT
New 3d printer based on Prusa's one but with great new features

Description : The T-BOT is using aluminium 2020 for the frame and 3d printed stuff for the assembly.
Some of the 3d printed files are directly taken from the prusa mk2 or mk3 and some of them are completely new. The motors are powered by the new TMC2130 drivers directly plugged on a custom Shield for RAMPS 1.4 (I deport the SPI port on the AUX3 to keep the LCD features)

Principal features :
- 300 x 200 heatbed with magnetic/removable buildtak
- Custom shield for RAMPS 1.4 in order to use the new Trinamics Silent drivers TMC2130 (and use the LCD on AUX3 too)
- wifi/ethernet/camera inside with RPI3
- custom PCB for powering the RPI3 directly from the 12V power supply
- print from thingiverse directly from the printer touch screen


New features will be coming soon, stay tuned...
