# T-BOT
New 3d printer based on Prusa's one but with great new features

Description : The T-BOT is using aluminium 2020 for the frame and 3d printed stuff for the assembly.
Some of the 3d printed files are directly taken from the prusa mk2 or mk3 and some of them are completely new.

Principal features :
- 300 x 200 heatbed with magnetic/removable buildtak
- Custom shield for RAMPS 1.4 in order to use the new Trinamics Silent drivers TMC2130 (and use the LCD on AUX3 too)
- wifi/ethernet connection
- camera
- print from thingiverse directly from the printer touch screen

New features will come soon (I'm planing to create a new pcb to control a multiplexer extruder directly from RAMPS)
