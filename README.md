# T-BOT
THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT !

The T-BOT is a new 3d printer based on the Prusa models with great new features.

Description : The T-BOT is using aluminium 2020 for the frame and 3d printed stuff for the assembly.
Some of the 3d printed files are directly taken from the prusa mk2 or mk3 and some of them are completely new. The motors are powered by the new TMC2130 drivers directly plugged on a custom Shield for RAMPS 1.4 (the AUX3 SPI port is deported to keep the LCD features ;)
The printer is running with the last version of the Marlin Firmware

FEATURES :
- 300 x 200 heatbed with magnetic/removable buildtak
- Custom shield for RAMPS 1.4 for the new Trinamics Silent drivers TMC2130
- wifi/ethernet/camera inside with RPI3
- custom PCB to power the RPI3 directly from the 12V power supply
- print from thingiverse directly from the printer touch screen


New features will be coming soon, stay tuned...
